        <h3>Mortgage Brokers work on a service-based model.</h3>
        <p>Without providing exceptional service, even the best Mortgage Broker will quickly go out of business.  More than half of all broker-sourced home loans Australia wide are initiated by a referral by someone who's had a great experience with the Broker in the past.  You should expect all Brisbane based Mortgage Brokers will work hard to provide an exceptional service to you, often working after-hours and weekends to make your life easier.</p>
        <h3>Why not go straight to the bank?</h3>
        <p>Going straight to the bank is a valid option, however a Mortgage Broker can provide a lot of value at no cost to you.  A Mortgage Broker can compare the various banks' policies and products to help get your loan approved the first time.  A large portion of people that apply through a bank directly don't make it to settlement - let us help take the pressure off and get you your home loan.  For more information, see <a href='./useful-information/mortgage-broker-vs-bank-pros-and-cons.php'>Mortgage Broker vs Bank - Pros and Cons</a>.</p>
        <h3>How do Home Loan Brokers get paid?</h3>
        <p>The bank paid us a commission for submitting the loan on your behalf.  We only get paid after settlement and as such make nothing if we can't get your loan approved.  Most banks pay very comparable commissions, however all commissions paid from the selected bank and it's competitors will be disclosed to you prior to your application.
