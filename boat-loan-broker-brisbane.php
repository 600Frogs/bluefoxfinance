            <h3>Boat Loan Broker FAQ:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>What is a boat loan?</h4>
                <p>A boat loan is similar to a personal loan, but it is secured by the boat in the same way a car secures a car loan.  Failure to make your repayments can result in the bank repossessing the boat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Can you finance all types of boats?</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately not.  We cannot finance: commercial leisure vessels, sub-leased boats, yachts, commercial style assets, inflatable boats, houseboats and pontoons.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why get a boat loan?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to finance a boat: a personal loan, a credit card, a boat loan or a home loan top-up.   Where possible, you should use equity in your home to purchase your boat, as this option will be the cheapest.  Without property to secure your loan against, the second cheapest option is to secure the loan against the boat itself, allowing the bank to give you an interest rate much cheaper than it otherwise would.

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Can you finance private sales?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes.  Private sales with or without an ABN are possible, although some will be subject to inspection.  Please contact us for further information about abnormal transactions.
