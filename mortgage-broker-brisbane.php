        <h3>Mortgage Brokers work on a service-based model.</h3>
        <p>Without providing exceptional service, even the best Mortgage Broker will quickly go out of business.  More than half of all broker-sourced home loans Australia wide are initiated by a referral by someone who's had a great experience with the Broker in the past.  You should expect all Brisbane based Mortgage Brokers will work hard to provide an exceptional service to you, often working after-hours and weekends to make your life easier.</p>
