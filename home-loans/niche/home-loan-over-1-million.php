    <h1>Home Loan over 1 Million Dollars</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>Home loans over 1 million dollars will generally require more due diligence to ensure the best outcome for the customer.  The interest rate becomes much more weighted than fees are when dealing with over a million dollar home loan - where a difference in interest of 0.10% p.a. will cost you upwards of $696 per year.  Paying 0.50%p.a. more than the lowest rate available on a million dollar home loan will cost you $3,480 per year!</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>We can help you find the best home loan for over a million dollars!</h2>
            <p>Whilst most banks will do loans over a million dollars, we work on a service-based commission model, meaning we can dedicate extra time to ensuring you get the best loan available.  We have over 25 lenders and can compare them all in real time, and produce you actual repayments (including fees) for your loan amount, to ensure you're not paying thousands more than you need to.  We don't charge for our service and can do after-hours and weekend appointments at the place of your choice.</p>

            <h3>Home Loans over a million FAQ:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>How much does my interest rate matter?</h4>
                <p>A lot!  Per million dollars, a difference of 0.01%p.a. means a difference in repayments of $69.60 per year.  So if you're paying 0.50% more than the lowest available (not an unusual situation), thats $3,480 per year wasted!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>What are the fees associated?</h4>
                <p>Nothing is required up-front, however each different lender has different fees applicable, all of which will be disclosed in full to you prior to your application.  We do not charge for our home loan services.</p>
