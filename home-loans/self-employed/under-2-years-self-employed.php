    <div class='flex-box'>

            <p>Most banks won't accept your home loan application if you've been self employed for less than 2 years, but you probably already know that.  The good news: even some of the major banks will accept it with a full year's tax return under their <a href='../../../self-employed-home-loans/low-doc-home-loan'>low doc</a> loans.  But if you don't have a full year's tax return, there are still lenders that will give you a low deposit home loan at 90% LVR.  Please note: all information on this page refers to applicants that have been self employed for 12 months, but not yet 2 years.  Please refer to our <a href='../../../self-employed-home-loan-requirements'>self employed home loan requirements</a> page if this is not you.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>We can help get you a mortgage when self employed for under 2 years.</h2>
            <p>At minimum, you will need a 10% deposit.  With a 10% deposit however, you should expect to pay high interest rates and fees - much higher than standard rates.  But if you want to get your home now, then we can get you approved at 10% and refinance to a lower rate in another 12 months if you're situation continues to improve.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why is it so difficult to get a home loan when self employed for under 2 years?</h4>
                <p>Most businesses don't have a consistent income for the first 12 months, it is not until 2 years that most banks feel they can get a sufficient grasp on how well the business is doing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do you charge for your service?</h4>
                <p>No.  The lender pays us a commission for a successful application so you needn't pay us anything.</p>
