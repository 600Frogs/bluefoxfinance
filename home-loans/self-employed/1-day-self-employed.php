    <div class='flex-box'>

            <p>A 1 day self employed mortgage is not readily available at the vast majority of lenders.  If you can get together a 30% deposit however, we might have a solution for you.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>A 1 day self employed mortgage can be done.</h2>
            <p>Without at least being self employed for 3 months, we will need a 30% deposit at absolute minimum.  We will also need to determine the income we should expect.  This can be done 1 of 2 ways: if you were previously in a PAYG position in the same industry for 2 years, we can look to use that income for your affordability calculations.  Alternatively, we will need an Accountant prepared business plan before we can look at submitting an application.</p>

            <h3>FAQ about our 1 day self employed home loan:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why is it so difficult to get a home loan when newly self employed?</h4>
                <p>Lenders like to feel safe about their investment.  When you've only been self employed for 1 day you are still high risk.  Many new businesses fail in the first 12 months and lenders don't want to be involved if that happens.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do you charge for your service?</h4>
                <p>No.  The lender pays us a commission for a successful application so you needn't pay us anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
