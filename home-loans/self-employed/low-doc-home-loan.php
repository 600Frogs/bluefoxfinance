    <h1>Low Doc Home Loan</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>A low doc home loan is generally suited to applicants that have been self employed as a sole trader or small business owner for over 12 months (24 months with many lenders), but doesn't yet have the documents required for a standard home loan application.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>Don't have a 2 full year's tax return?  A low doc home loan might suit you.</h2>
            <p>Different lenders have different requirements, but the easiest low doc home loan with a major lender will require your ABN and GST be registered for a minimum of 12 months, and you must be able to supply 12 months' worth of BAS statements; bank statements may be required also.

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>I have been trading for a year but don't have 12 months' BAS done.</h4>
                <p>Without doing 12 months' BAS, you won't apply for a standard low doc home loan.  You would instead be looking at a specialised alt doc home loan.  Contact us for more details.</p>
