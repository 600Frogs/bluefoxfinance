    <h1>Self Employed Home Loans: Less than 1 year</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>Being self employed for less than 1 year can make a home loan application with a traditional bank impossible.  There are however some alternative lenders that will be happy to look at your application if you meet their requirements.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>We can help get you a mortgage when self employed for under 12 months.</h2>
            <p>You should expect to need a 20% deposit minimum in all cases, you will also be subject to higher-than-normal interest rates and fees.  If you're looking for a home loan when employed for only 6 months, you are best to use alternative lenders as a stepping stone to a competitive home loan product with a major bank.  Once approved for a 6 month self employed mortgage, you are best to look at refinancing as soon as is reasonable: usually once you have been self employed for over 2 years.</p>
            <p>Been self-employed for over 12 months?  Check out our <a href='../../../self-employed-home-loan-requirements'>self employed home loans</a> page.  Not self employed?  Look at our <a href='../../../mortgage-broker-brisbane'>Mortgage Broker Brisbane</a> page.</p>

            <h3>FAQ about our self employed home loan less than 1 year:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why is it so difficult to get a home loan when self employed for under 12 months?</h4>
                <p>Lenders like to feel safe about their investment.  When you've only been self employed for less than 1 year, you are still high risk.  Many new businesses fail in the first 12 months and lenders don't want to be involved if that happens.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do you charge for your service?</h4>
                <p>No.  The lender pays us a commission for a successful application so you needn't pay us anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Can you do after-hours appointments?</h4>
                <p>Yes!  After-hours and weekend appointments are welcomed, although your finance application will generally only be processed on week days.</p>
            </div>
