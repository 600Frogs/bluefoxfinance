    <h1>Self Employed Home Loan Requirements</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>Self employed home loan requirements aren't that always that much different from a regular application.  In general, you will need to meet regular lending guidelines, and supply sufficient financials on top: usually, BAS statements, tax returns, NOA's (Notice of Assessments) and sometimes a letter from the accountant.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>Self Employed Home Loan Requirements are based on how long you've had a registered ABN.</h2>
            <p>Most lenders require you to be self employed for 2 years or more, with 2 years tax returns.  Low doc loans are available with some lenders with 1 year's registered ABN and a full year's tax return.  There are also alternative lenders that will often lend even if you've only started your business yesterday - details are further down the page.</p>

            <h3>FAQ about our self employed home loan requirements:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why do the requirements differ so much?</h4>
                <p>Each of the different requirements and LVR bands listed above are with different lenders.  Finding one lender that is willing to do everything is difficult and often not the best option.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Which lenders provide these mortgages?</h4>
                <p>The list of lenders ranges greatly.  Out of approx. 35 lenders, only 1 will do a loan when self employed for less than 3 months, and only 3 will do under 12 months.  Once you get over 12 months, your options open up a little, and most lenders will do a full doc loan when you have 2 full years' tax returns.  Please <a href='../../../contact'>contact us</a> about your situation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do you charge for your service?</h4>
                <p>No.  The lender pays us a commission for a successful application so you needn't pay us anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Can you do after-hours appointments?</h4>
                <p>Yes!  After-hours and weekend appointments are welcomed, although your finance application will generally only be processed on week days.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
