    <h1>Home Loan for Small Business</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>Owning a small business makes a home loan application more complex, but generally won't lower your chance of getting approved.  Mortgages for small business owners that have been operating for less than 2 years will have the same restrictions as sole traders: see <a href='../../../self-employed-home-loan-requirements'>self employed home loan requirements</a> for more information.  The main difference when owning a small business is that the lender will want to see additional supporting documents: tax returns for the company, any trusts, trustees, and company directors (usually holding >25% share).</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>Small business home loans need not be difficult.</h2>
            <p>We can help walk you through the entire process, check your eligibility, affordability and help take the hard work out of applying for a home loan as a small business owner.  Not sure how a Mortgage Broker can help you?  Check out our <a href='../../../self-employed-home-loan-requirements'>self employed home loans</a> page.  Not self employed?

            <h3>FAQ about our small business owner home loans:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>What's different between being a sole trader and a small business owner?</h4>
                <p>Not much when it comes to a finance application.  Being incorporated will just require additional documents be provided to support your application.</p>
            </div>

                <h4>Do you charge for your service?</h4>
                <p>No.  The lender pays us a commission for a successful application so you needn't pay us anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Can you do after-hours appointments?</h4>
