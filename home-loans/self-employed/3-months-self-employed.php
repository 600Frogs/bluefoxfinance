    <h1>Self Employed Home Loans: 3 Months</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>Getting a home loan when you've been self employed for only 3 months can be extremely difficult.  The vast majority of lenders will not accept your application, and even most of the non-traditional lenders won't accept your income until you've been self employed for 12 - 24 months.  We get it, it's hard, but we might have a solution for you!</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>A 3 months self employed home loan is possible!</h2>
            <p>Let's firstly clear up a couple of things: whilst a 3 month self employed mortgage is possible, it does have stricter eligibility criteria and higher costs.  In most cases, you will be looking between 6.79%p.a. interest and 9.74%p.a. interest, with an upfront fee of between 0.75% and 1.25% (as at 17/01/2018). a 20% deposit is always mandatory, and some locations and loan amount may not be possible.  But if you do have a 20% deposit + costs handy, let's talk.  We will be looking at your business and personal bank account statements for the last 3 months to determine your income, and may also require a letter from your accountant - then we can look at getting you a pre approval or full approval.</p>
            <p>Are there other options?  It depends on your situation, but options are limited.  Our 3 month self employed home loan option is generally used as a stepping stone: it will get you the house you want, and we can then look to refinance you when you have a longer track record of being self employed.  Not self employed?  Look at our <a href='../../../mortgage-broker-brisbane'>Mortgage Broker Brisbane</a> page.</p>

            <h3>FAQ about our 3 month self employed home loan:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why is it so difficult to get a home loan when self employed for 3 months?</h4>
                <p>Lenders like to feel safe about their investment.  When you've only been self employed for 3 months you are still high risk.  Many new businesses fail in the first 12 months and lenders don't want to be involved if that happens.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do you charge for your service?</h4>
                <p>No.  The lender pays us a commission for a successful application so you needn't pay us anything.</p>
