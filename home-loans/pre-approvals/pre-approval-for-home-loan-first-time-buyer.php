            <p>Getting a <a href='../../../home-loans/pre-approvals/what-is-a-pre-approval'>pre approval</a> for a home loan as a first time buyer can seem daunting, but it's actually a simple, cost-free process.  <a href='../../../home-loans/pre-approvals/pre-approval-process-for-a-home-loan'>The pre approval process for a home loan</a> has a few steps, but a <a href='../../../'>Mortgage Broker</a> can help explain in detail and walk you through the entire process.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>How much does a home loan pre approval for a first time buyer cost?</h2>
            <p>Nothing!  Well...usually nothing.  Some Mortgage Brokers and lenders do charge a fee, however the vast majority do not - including us..</p>

            <h2>How do I apply for my first home loan pre approval?</h2>
            <p>Step one is to talk to a Mortgage Broker.  A Mortgage Broker can look at your situation, check your eligibility, your affordability and find you the best deal.  Once you have been 'pre-qualified' by a Mortgage Broker, you can submit the requested documents to them and ask them to apply for a pre approval with the lender of your choice.  After the lender assess your situation, they will give you a 'conditional approval' or 'approval in principal', which are just synonyms for a pre approval.</p>
            <h2>Will being a first time buyer make it harder to get a pre approval?</h2>
            <p>Nope.  In many cases, lenders actually look at first time buyers as lower risk than other borrowers!</p>
