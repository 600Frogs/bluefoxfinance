    <h1>Free pre approval for a home loan.</h1>
    <div class='flex-box'>
        <div class='flex-box half-width'>
            <p>Acquiring a free <a href='../../../home-loans/pre-approvals/what-is-a-pre-approval'>pre approval</a> for a home loan should be easy in most cases.  90% of lenders and <a href='../../../'>Mortgage Brokers</a> will not charge anything to submit and approve your home loan pre approval application, however some do - and others exclude pre approvals all together.  We can help explain <a href='../../../home-loans/pre-approvals/pre-approval-process-for-a-home-loan'>the pre approval process for a home loan</a> and guarantee you upfront that all our home loan services are free.  If you have any questions upfront or down the track, you are always welcome to send us an email or call us and ask - we are happy to help you navigate the process.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>Why is a home loan pre approval free?</h2>
            <p>Mortgage Brokers and banks both want your business.  A <a href='../../../useful-information/how-does-a-mortgage-broker-get-paid'>Mortgage Broker gets paid a commission</a> when your pre approval is turned into a final approval, and the bank gets your business, and in turn, interest payments.  The customer, the broker and the bank all benefit from providing free pre approvals to potential clients.</p>

            <h2>How do I get a free home loan pre approval?</h2>
            <p>Talk to us or another Mortgage Broker of your choice.  After getting your details and financial position, we can assess your eligibility, likelihood of approval, maximum borrowing capacity, find the best home loan deal and then submit the application on your behalf.  You will no doubt have a lot of questions in the initial and later stages, so having a professional working for you to answer those questions can be invaluable in many cases.</p>
            <h2>What documents will I need to submit to get my free pre approval?</h2>
            <p>The same documents as you would a regular home loan application without a contract of sale: payslips, identification, bank statements, liability statements and other relevant documents.  Another advantage of applying for a pre approval is that you can request some documents not be provided until a later date.  Driver licence expired or bank won't give you a recent statement for 2 weeks?  We can request that certain documents not be provided until formal approval, meaning we can get your pre approval without full documentation in many cases.</p>
