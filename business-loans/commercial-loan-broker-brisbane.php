            <p>A Commerical Loan Broker can help finance a wide variety of commercial properties.  Commercial property loan scenarios are seldom the same, with certain banks only lending against certain securities.  After gaining a full understanding of you/your business, and the property you are looking to purchase/refinance, we can talk to a wide variety of lenders and provide you with the lowest indicative funding proposal we can find.</p>
            <h2 class='reduce-size'>A Commercial Loan Broker can negotiate on your behalf.</h2>
            <p>Going to only a couple of lenders can often cause issues with approvals and costs.  Commercial property loan's interest rates and fees can range significantly from lender-to-lender, and are seldom set in stone.  By talking to multiple banks and making them compete against other willing lenders will often save you money.</p>

            <h3>Commercial Loan Broker FAQ:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why use a Commercial Loan Broker?</h4>
                <p>A Commercial Loan Broker Brisbane can save you a lot of time and money in most cases.  We work hard to ensure we are finding you the best deal available with a lender that suits you.  We won't only compare the big 4 banks, but will look at second tier lenders and the smaller lenders too.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Can you get an interest rate cheaper than going directly to the bank?</h4>
                <p>Whilst we can rarely get a pre-set discount on interest rates, our ability to repeatedly talk to the banks about your situation can often get you a better rate.  After looking for the cheapest interest rate offers, we will return to other interested lenders and insist they will need to lower their rate to get your business.  Whilst this process can generally be done yourself, it is very time consuming and we already have the right contacts to enable us to request interest rate and fee discounts.</p>
