                <h4>How many lenders do you deal with?</h4>
                <p>Whilst we have access to over 25 lenders, different lenders only allow us access to certain products, giving us a different array of lenders for each product.  Nevertheless, we can still talk to lenders on your behalf, and if the best lender for you isn't one we can deal directly with, we're happy to give you this information and refer you onto their business banker.</p>
