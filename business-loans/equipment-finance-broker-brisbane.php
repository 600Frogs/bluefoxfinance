            <h3>Equipment Finance Broker FAQ:</h3>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why use an Equipment Finance Broker?</h4>
                <p>An equipment finance broker can take the hard work out of finance.  Instead of explaining your situation and providing financials to multiple lenders, we are a one-stop-shop and can take your information and anonymously get quotes from various lenders on your behalf.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>What sort of interest rate should I expect?</h4>
                <p>This can vary significantly based on the equipment being financed, the health of your business and the risk associated.  We work with some of the largest lenders, and some smaller lenders too, so can generally find a very competitive interest rate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Why use equipment finance?</h4>
                <p>Equipment finance can be used to purchase most common business assets.  It can be used where the capital isn’t currently available, or just to retain capital for future use.  Because the equipment loan is secured by the asset you are purchasing, the lender will be able to give you the loan at a significant discount to an unsecured loan, making equipment finance a great option.</p>

                <p>Yes.  Private sales with or without an ABN are possible, although some will be subject to inspection.  Please contact us for further information about abnormal transactions.</p>
